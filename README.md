 # **Combat Carbon**
Combat Carbon is an all-in-one carbon emission tracking web application built that helps individuals calculate
their carbon emissions based on aspects like transportation, utilities, etc.
It includes a chatbot that answers questions and can make reccomendations to users on which route to 
use, it does so through a machine learning model utlising random forest regression.
It uses flask on the backend, and SQLite for database, along with RESTful API. Botpress was used to 
make the bots to include generative AI features integrated with the ML model.

# **What are we trying to solve?**
Global warming is a direct problem and climate change too. Recent heat 
waves in Bengaluru made 
us deeply think about climate change and its impact. Hence, we decided to build a emission tracker 
that tracks carbon emissions and in turn helps us reduce our emissions and do our bit to 
fight climate change. The main idea is that tracking can lead to more mindful consumption.

# How to get started?
- do these things to run our applications

# Problems with existing solutions
- Lack of appropriate AI ML model integrations
- Lack of dedicated chatbots
- Lack of one-stop solution

# Solution


# Working and features
- Sign in with user authentication using email OTP 
- Dashboard showing emission calculator which calculates total carbon emissions
- Graphical representation of the calculated emissions with respective categories
- ChatBot answering the user's questions
- Machine Learning model using Random Forest Regression model to predict emissions based on transport routes
- Database stores the entered user data for future usage

  
# We ran into the following challenges
- Finding suitable dataset and problems training ML model appropriately.
- Integrating flask and the AI powered ML recomendation engine.

# Scope for further enhancements
- Improve UI
- Introduce points based system to encourage users to stay motivated
