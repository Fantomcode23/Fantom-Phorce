# **Phantom Carbon**
Phantom Carbon is an all in one carbon emission tracking app built that helps individuals calculate
their carbon emissions based one 3 aspects- transportation, utilities, and internet usage. 
It includes a chatbot that answers questions and can make reccomendations to users which route to 
use, it does so through a machine learning model with random forest regression.
It uses flask on the backend, and sqllite for dbms, along with RESTful API. Botpress was used to 
make the bots to include generative AI features integrated with the ML model.

# **What are we trying to solve?**
Global warming is a direct problem and climate change too. Recent heat waves in Bengaluru made 
us think about climate change and its impact. Hence, we decided to build a emission tracker 
that tracks carbon emissions and in turn helps us reduce our emissions and do our bit to 
fight climate change.

# Technology Stack 
## Web application
- HTML
- CSS
- Flask (Python)
- SQLite
## AI-ML powered chatbot
- BotPress
- TensorFlow 

# How to get started?
- do these things to run our applications

# Problems with existing solutions
- Lack of appropriate AI ML model integrations
- Lack of dedicated chatbots
- Lack of one-stop solution

# Solution
this is how our apploication solves the problem and also the lack of existing solutions

# Working and features
These are the features available on our application 

# We ran into the following challenges
- Finding suitable dataset and problems training ML model appropriately.
- Integrating flask and the AI powered ML recomendation engine.

# Scope for further enhancements
Here's what we can do improve our application.
